Abstract


The process of determining the identity of a Persian poet involves examining the characteristics of Persian poetry and literature. This involves analyzing the words used in the poem, as well as the rhythm and format of the poem. By calculating the weighted frequency of these features, a model can be trained to recognize the author of the poem. This approach is a new way of identifying the identity of a Persian poet, inspired by the method used by Persian poetry experts to experimentally identify the poet. Text-mining techniques are used to extract features from the text of poems, which become the criteria for evaluating poetry. The poem is then evaluated based on these characteristics, and the probability is calculated based on these features to determine the most likely poet. A bag of words is created for words extracted from the text, and unique words are considered features. The rhythms and formats were inferred from the poems in the dataset. Features were added to the training set after pre-processing and TFIDF calculations. During preprocessing, a rule-based technique is used to classify and calculate the features. The proposed model was compared to multiple models, including different versions of the proposed model, in several stages. Several test sets were created, and the performance of the model was evaluated.
