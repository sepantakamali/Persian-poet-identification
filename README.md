Abstract

In identifying the identity of the Persian poet, features of Persian poetry and literature are discussed, which leads to
learning and identifying the identity of the poet. The presented approach deals with the analysis of the words used in the
poem, the rhythm and format of the poem, and by calculating the weighted frequency for these features, it trains a
model to be able to recognize the author of the poem. This approach is a new way to identify the identity of the Persian
poet, which is inspired by the method used by Persian poetry experts to identify the poet experimentally. In this
approach, using text mining techniques, features are extracted from the text of poems and become a criterion for
evaluating poetry. Finally, the poem is evaluated from the aspect of these characteristics. Then, the probability is
calculated based on these features so that the most likely poet is chosen as the poet. A bag of words is created for words
extracted from the text and unique words are considered as features. The rhythms and formats are inferred from the
poems in the dataset. Features are added to the training set after preprocessing and TFIDF calculation. In pre-
processing, Rule Based technique is used to classify and calculate features. The proposed model is compared in several
stages and with multiple models, including different versions of the proposed model. Several test sets are created and the
performance of the model is evaluated.
